## Name
Thermal Physics Project: Analysing the OD transition of Cu3Au.

## Description
This project plots two graphs, one of specific molar heat capacity against temperature and another of specific molar heat per temperature against temperature. The code also calculates the molar entropy change accross the OD transition, between 500 K and 720 K. Using data collected from the supplementary material from https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925838815000109
